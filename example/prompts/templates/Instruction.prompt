Refactor my go app.
Currently it is completely working locally, but I want to change it to have an api and a database, while keeping the cli functionality.
I splitted the app into 2 main programs: api and cli.

Take the given `main.go` file, and refactor it into the new structure.
Add api functionality, as well as database storage for the data.

For a start the api should have the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/prompts` - returns the history of all generated prompts
- `POST /api/prompts` - generates a new prompt and returns it
- `GET /api/prompts/{id}` - returns the prompt with the given id
- `DELETE /api/prompts/{id}` - deletes the prompt with the given id

The database should be a PostgreSQL database, and should have the following table:
- `prompts` - id, prompt, created_at, updated_at

The cli should have the following commands:
- `generate` - takes the files from the `templates` folder, and generates a prompt from them, and posts it to the api
